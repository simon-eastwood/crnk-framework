                                <p n="0001" xml:id="_341af00004">The present invention relates generally to prosthetic joints, and more particularly to a modular prosthetic knee
                                    joint system that includes a metaphyseal sleeve component.
                                </p>
                                <p n="0002" xml:id="_341af00005">The knee joint basically consists of the bone interface of the distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the
                                    tibia. Appearing to cover or at least partially protect this interface is the patella, which is a sesamoid bone within the tendon of the long
                                    muscle (quadriceps) on the front of the thigh. This tendon inserts into the tibial tuberosity and the posterior surface of the patella is smooth
                                    and glides over the femur.
                                </p>
                                <p n="0003" xml:id="_341af00006">The femur is configured with two knob like processes (the medial condyle and the lateral condyle) which are
                                    substantially smooth and which articulate with the medial plateau and the lateral plateau of the tibia, respectively. The plateaus of the tibia
                                    are substantially smooth and slightly cupped thereby providing a slight receptacle for receipt of the femoral condyles.
                                </p>
                                <p n="0004" xml:id="_341af00007">When the knee joint is damaged whether as a result of an accident or illness, a prosthetic replacement of the
                                    damaged joint may be necessary to relieve pain and to restore normal use to the joint. Typically the entire knee joint is replaced by means of a
                                    surgical procedure that involves removal of the surfaces of the corresponding damaged bones and replacement of these surfaces with prosthetic
                                    implants. This replacement of a native joint with a prosthetic joint is referred to as a primary total-knee arthroplasty.

                                <p n="0005" xml:id="_341af00008">On occasion, the primary knee prostheses fails. Failure can result from many causes, including wear, aseptic
                                    loosening, osteolysis, ligamentous instability, arthrofibrosis and patellofemoral complications. When the failure is debilitating, revision knee
                                    surgery may be necessary. In a revision, the primary knee prosthesis is removed and replaced with components of a revision prosthetic knee
                                    system.

                                    including DePuy Synthes. DePuy Synthes and others offer several different systems for both primary and revision applications. For example, DePuy
                                    Synthes offers systems under the trade marks PFC SIGMA, LCS and S-ROM. These orthopaedic knee systems includes several components, some
                                    appropriate for use in primary knee arthroplasty and some appropriate for use in revision surgery.

                                <p n="0007" xml:id="_341af00010">DePuy Synthes also offers other orthopaedic implant systems for other applications. One such system is the system
                                    sold under the trade mark LPS. The LPS system is provided for use in cases of severe trauma and disease. In such cases, the trauma or disease
                                    can lead to significant amounts of bone loss. The LPS system provides components that can replace all or significant portions of a particular

                                    filled by standard knee implants. The presence of such metaphyseal defects can result in loosening of the prosthetic implant over time,
                                    compromising the stability of the prosthetic implant and frequently requiring revision of the prosthetic implant.
                                </p>
                                <p n="0009" xml:id="_341af00012">To fill metaphyseal cavitary defects, knee systems with modular metaphyseal sleeves have been provided. Such

                                    US-4634444. Such sleeves have been used in commercially available prosthetic knee implant systems, such as those sold under the trade marks PFC
                                    SIGMA, LCS, S-ROM and LPS.

                                <p n="0010" xml:id="_341af00013">Modular sleeves have also been used in hip implant systems, as disclosed in, for example, US-6264699, US-4790852.
                                    Such hip sleeves have been used in commercially available prosthetic hip implant systems, such as the S-ROM hip systems, available from DePuy

                                <p n="0011" xml:id="_341af00014">In knee systems with modular metaphyseal sleeves, the conventional shape of many of the sleeves is generally an
                                    elliptical cone with a large ellipse profile close to the joint line tapering down to a smaller elliptical or circular profile at the
                                    termination of the component distal to the joint line. Generally, the sleeves have a terraced or stepped outer surface and an inner channel for
                                    frictional fixation to another component. This geometry fills cavitary defects in the metaphysis, allows for a wider surface area for load
                                    transfer through the joint and provides rotational stability for the articulating components of the prosthesis.
                                </p>
                                <p n="0012" xml:id="_341af00015">The outer surface of the sleeve is supported by solid bony structure or the bone bed. In the case of the distal
                                    femur, patient anatomy and the condition of the bone, particularly in a revision surgery, may require that the distal femur be resected to a

                                    proximal level. Implanting a prosthetic distal femoral component and sleeve at this more proximal level may elevate the joint line (that is, the
                                    line defined by the articulation of the articular surfaces of the distal femoral component and proximal tibial component). Elevation of the
                                    joint line may adversely affect performance of the prosthetic knee system: the positions of the collateral ligament attachments to the femur
                                    relative to the joint line may impact knee kinematics, the articulation of the patella against the femoral component will be impacted, and the
                                    function of the extensor mechanism will also be impacted.

                                    serve to augment the inferior and posterior portions of the femoral component to add additional thickness to compensate for the lack of
                                    sufficient boney tissue, allowing the joint line to be distalized. However, with the femoral component so distalized, the metaphyseal sleeve
                                    used with the femoral component may no longer be optimally seated on a healthy bone bed. To compensate, surgeons may sometimes opt to use a

                                    stabilized component. The system shown in FIG. 1 also includes a femoral stem 16, along with a collar 18 for placement between the stem 16 and
                                    the distal femoral component 10 and a bolt 20 so that the stem 16 and collar 18 may be selectively mounted on the distal femoral component. Each
                                    stem 16 has a frusto-conical outer surface that is
                                    smooth and tapers from a maximum outer diameter at the distal end to smaller outer diameters at positions proximal to the distal end. Stem
                                    extensions 22 are also provided. All of the above components may be standard parts of the knee system sold under the trade mark PFC SIGMA by
                                    DePuy Synthes, for example. Each stem 16 is an adapter with features like those disclosed in US-A-2006/0030945. The stems 16 may also have
                                    features like those disclosed in US-6171342, US-5824097 and US-5782921. Also as disclosed in US-A-2006/0030945, the stem extension may have
                                    features other than those shown in FIG. 1. Optionally, the femoral component 10 may have an integral stem 16 instead of the stem adapter 16,
                                    collar 18 and bolt 20.

                                    224A, 224B, and the proximal portion of the larger size sleeve will fit within the opening prepared in the femur to receive the smaller sleeve
                                    and extend distally from the bone by the distance "X" or "X+Y" thereby to offset the joint line distally. The thickness 442 of the distal
